Task: I lead a team of Data Scientist on the development of a recommendation system(content based or collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms)

FINAL NOTEBOOK_RECOMMENDATION _SYSTEM: This the ipynb file (Jupyter notebook) it contains all the codes for thos project.

Streamlit.py : This file is a streamlit app for deploying the recommedation system.
                Ensure the surprise model is installed on your machine before running it 
                To run it use "streamlit run streamlit.py"




In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical to ensure that individuals can make optimised choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true is movie recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from millions of options.

With this context, EDSA has consulted EDKO Consultings to construct a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their historical preferences.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being personalised recommendations - generating platform affinity for the streaming services which best facilitates their audience's viewing.

A recommender system functions by predicting a user's rating or preference for an item. This allows a service provider to build up a catalog of items which it believes the user will want to examine - thereby increasing their engagement with the service and allowing a wider array of content to be considered.
