            ensure that individuals can make optimised choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily \
            basis. One application where this is especially true is movie recommendations; where intelligent algorithms\
             can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.With this context, EDSA has consulted\
              EDKO Consultings(2110ACDS_T14) to construct a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative \
              filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based\
               on their historical preferences.Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense \
               economic potential, with users of the system being personalised recommendations - generating platform \
               affinity for the streaming services which best facilitates their audience's viewing.A recommender system \
               functions by predicting a user's rating or preference for an item. This allows a service provider to build\
                up a catalog of items which it believes the user will want to examine - thereby increasing their engagement with the service and allowing a wider array of content to be considered.")
